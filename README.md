# "Amnesiac Justice": Unraveling the Forgotten Crime

## Overview

"Amnesiac Justice" is a text-based and role-playing adventure game, written in Scala. 
The player will be a prisoner, who has lost his memory and tries to escape from the prison.
After each round, the player will get a hint about his past through involved locations, items or 
by some none-player characters (npc). Finally, if the player answers correctly the questions about his crime,
the player will be free.

### Hints and rounds
The player is available to choose between rooms and whether to elaborate the room and receive the hint or not.

**Round 1:** There are 3 rooms. Each room contains one item.

**Round 2:** There are 2 rooms. One is the place the prisoner came to before commiting the crime, the other is after commiting the crime.

**Round 3:** There are 2 rooms. Each room contains one person, who has close relationship with the player.

**Final round - Judgement session:** The player must answer 2 questions. One is about the crime, the other is about the prisoner's motivation.
Either of the wrong answers leads to failure and the player moves back to the prison.

### Instructions
The player can freely type anything into the console, as long as it directly answers the questions. 

For example, if the question is "Which room do you choose ?", the answer can be "room 2", "2", "I choose room 2", etc. An wrong command will not lead to anything. The question will be repeated until you command correctly.
